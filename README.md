This MATLAB script takes in a csv file of IMU data, x,y,z accelerations, and x,y,z rotations. The format of the csv should be the same as the one in the repository.
This will output 6 plyfit equations that can be copied into ANSYS or C++, and it generates graphs of how well the functions fit with the data. I used it for UDFs and
defining accelerations within ANSYS Fluent simulation.
